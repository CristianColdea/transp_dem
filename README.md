## General info
The object of the present project is to code two in use methods for short term transportation demand, i.e., Fratar and Furness. Additionally, an original new method is proposed.
The motivation is based on the need to create helper piece of code to work with my classes and personal project.

## Screenshots

## Technologies
Python3 and its math module
matplotlib (later to be used in order to generate the appropriate graphs)

## Setup
Just read the docstrings and be carefull to matrices dimensions

## Code Examples
Show examples of usage:
`class GravitMod()`

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
*~~Get ready the README file and the project outline.~~
* ~~Code the class to contain the needed methods.~~
* ~~Code the new method.~~
* Code Fratar method.
* Code Furness method.
* Code Gravitational Model method in order to establish a baseline.
* Code two methods (classical and weighted) to determine the Gravitational Model calibration coefficients.
  
To-do list:
* Wow improvement to be done 1
* Wow improvement to be done 2
